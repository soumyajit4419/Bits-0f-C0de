### What is git? {#What-is-git}

Git is a version control system which is maintained on your local system. Git gives us a record for ongoing programming versions. It can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service i.e. we don’t even need internet to access git.

#### Version Control System {#Version-Control-System}

![What is VCS](/BL-1001/vcs.png)

It is a program to keep track of the changes in projects, by tracking or logging the files changes over time. A version control system allows us to review, restore earlier versions and even branching and merging or code.

### What Is GitHub? {#What-Is-GitHub}

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets us manage Git repositories. It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer.
Other Git repository hosting services also exist: Eg:- GitLab, BitBucket, and SourceForge

GitHub just takes things a little bit further than Git, offering more functionality and resources, as well as a place online to store and collaborate on projects. And because GitHub is cloud-based, an individual’s Git repositories can be remotely accessed by any authorized person, from any computer, anywhere in the world.

Through GitHub, one can share code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches. This makes it possible for entire teams to coordinate together on single projects in real-time. As changes are introduced, new branches are created, allowing the team to continue to revise the code without overwriting each other's work.
